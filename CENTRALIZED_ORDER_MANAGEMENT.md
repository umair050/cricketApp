## 💻 Technical Implementation

### Data Loading

```javascript
// Load all grounds
const groundsData = await groundsService.getMyGrounds();

// Load bookings for each ground in parallel
const bookingsPromises = groundsData.map((ground) =>
  groundsService.getGroundBookings(ground.id).catch(() => [])
);
const bookingsArrays = await Promise.all(bookingsPromises);

// Flatten into single array
const combined = bookingsArrays.flat();
```

### Filtering Logic

```javascript
// Apply status filter
if (filterStatus !== "all") {
  filteredBookings = filteredBookings.filter((b) => b.status === filterStatus);
}

// Apply ground filter
if (filterGround !== "all") {
  filteredBookings = filteredBookings.filter(
    (b) => b.ground?.id === filterGround
  );
}
```

### Phone Extraction

```javascript
const extractPhone = (notes) => {
  const match = notes?.match(/Contact:\s*([+\d\s-]+)/);
  return match ? match[1].trim() : null;
};
```

## 🎯 Key Differences: Centralized vs Individual

| Feature           | Centralized (All Bookings) | Individual (Single Ground)                   |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Scope**         | All grounds                | One specific ground                          |
| **Access**        | Sidebar → "Manage Orders"  | My Grounds → Ground Card → "Manage Bookings" |
| **Ground Filter** | Yes (dropdown)             | No (pre-filtered)                            |
| **Stats**         | Aggregated across all      | Specific to ground                           |
| **Use Case**      | Daily management           | Focus on one ground                          |
| **Navigation**    | Direct from sidebar        | Via My Grounds page                          |

## 📊 Statistics Calculations

### Total Bookings

```javascript
all: bookings.length;
```

### By Status

completed: bookings.filter((b) => b.status === "completed").length;
rejected: bookings.filter((b) => b.status === "rejected").length;
cancelled: bookings.filter((b) => b.status === "cancelled").length;
```

### Revenue

```javascript
// Total paid revenue
totalRevenue = bookings
  .filter((b) => b.isPaid)
  .reduce((sum, b) => sum + parseFloat(b.totalAmount || 0), 0);

// Pending revenue
pendingRevenue = bookings
  .filter((b) => b.status === "pending" || b.status === "confirmed")
  .reduce((sum, b) => sum + parseFloat(b.totalAmount || 0), 0);
```
