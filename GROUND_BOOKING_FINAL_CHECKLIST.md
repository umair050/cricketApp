## 📋 Quick Troubleshooting for "My Bookings" Not Showing

### Issue: Bookings exist in database but not showing in UI

**Possible Causes:**

### 1. **User Mismatch**

The booking is for userId: 3, but you might be logged in as a different user.

**Check:**

- Open browser console (`F12`)
- Type: `document.cookie`
- Look for the user ID in the cookie
- Booking will only show if logged in as user ID 3

**Solution:**

- Login as the user who created the booking
- OR create a new booking with your current user

---

### 2. **API Call Not Being Made**

**Check:**

- Open DevTools → Network tab
- Go to "My Bookings" page
- Look for request to `grounds/bookings/user/my-bookings`
- Check if it returns data

**If no request is made:**

- Hard refresh (`Ctrl+F5`)
- Check console for errors

**If request returns empty:**

- You're logged in as wrong user
- Create new booking with current user

---

### 3. **Redux State Issue**

**Debug in Console:**

```javascript
// Check Redux state
console.log(window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__);
```

Or check console logs - I've added debugging that logs:

```
My Bookings Data: { myBookings: [...], loading: false, error: null }
```

---

## 🔍 Step-by-Step Debug

### Step 1: Verify You're Logged In

```javascript
// In browser console
Cookies.get("user"); // Should show user data
Cookies.get("token"); // Should show JWT token
```

### Step 2: Check Your User ID

The booking belongs to userId: 3. Check if you're user 3:

```javascript
JSON.parse(Cookies.get("user")).id; // Should be 3
```

### Step 3: Test API Directly

Open this in browser (while logged in):

```
http://localhost:3001/grounds/bookings/user/my-bookings
```

Should return array with your booking.

### Step 4: Create New Booking

If you're a different user, just create a new booking:

1. Go to "Browse Grounds"
2. Click on a ground
3. Click "Book Now"
4. Fill the form and submit
5. Go to "My Bookings" - should appear!

## 🐛 If Bookings Don't Show

**Most Likely:** You're logged in as a different user than who created the booking.

**Quick Fix:**

1. Create a NEW booking with your current logged-in user
2. Go to "My Bookings"
3. It will appear!

**Check User ID:**

```javascript
// In browser console
const user = JSON.parse(Cookies.get("user"));
console.log("Current User ID:", user.id);
console.log("Booking User ID:", 3); // From database
```

If they don't match, that's why it's not showing!
