## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Database Setup

Run the migration SQL to create all tables:

```bash
# Using psql
psql -U postgres -d cricketapp -f backend/database/migrations/create_ground_booking_tables.sql

# Or connect to your database and run the SQL file
```

**Note:** The migration will create:
- 4 tables: `grounds`, `ground_slots`, `bookings`, `payments`
- 6 enum types for status fields
- Indexes for performance
- Triggers for automatic timestamp updates

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

All dependencies are already included in your project. If needed:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

### Step 3: Start the Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm run start:dev
```

The API will be available at: `http://localhost:3000/api/grounds`

## 📊 Database Schema Overview

```
users (existing)
  ↓
grounds (owner relationship)
  ↓
ground_slots (time slots)
  ↓
bookings (user + ground + slots)
  ↓

## 🎨 Frontend Integration Guide

### Step 1: Create Ground Booking Pages

```javascript
// Pages to create:
- /grounds/browse - Browse all grounds
- /grounds/:id - Ground details page
- /grounds/create - Create ground (owners)
- /grounds/my-grounds - Manage grounds (owners)
- /bookings/create - Booking form
- /bookings/my-bookings - User's bookings
- /payments/checkout - Payment page
```

### Step 2: Create API Service

```javascript
// src/services/groundsService.js
import axios from 'axios';

const API_URL = 'http://localhost:3000/api/grounds';

export const groundsService = {
  // Browse grounds
  getGrounds: (filters) => 
    axios.get(API_URL, { params: filters }),
  
  // Get ground details
  getGroundById: (id) => 
    axios.get(`${API_URL}/${id}`),
  
  // Check availability
  checkAvailability: (data) => 
    axios.post(`${API_URL}/availability/check`, data),
  
  // Create booking
  createBooking: (data, token) => 
    axios.post(`${API_URL}/bookings`, data, {
      headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` }
    }),
  
  // Get user bookings
  getMyBookings: (token) => 
    axios.get(`${API_URL}/bookings/user/my-bookings`, {
      headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` }
    }),
};
```

### Step 3: Create Components

Key components to build:
- `GroundCard` - Display ground in list

- `AvailabilityCalendar` - Show available slots
- `BookingForm` - Create booking
- `PaymentForm` - Process payment
- `BookingCard` - Display booking info

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Before Going Live:

1. **Enable synchronize in TypeORM**
   ```typescript
   // app.module.ts
   synchronize: true, // Or run migrations manually
   ```

2. **Setup Payment Gateway**
   - Integrate Stripe/Razorpay/PayPal
   - Setup webhook endpoints
   - Test in sandbox mode

3. **Add Admin Role Check**
   - Create admin guard for approve/reject endpoints
   - Implement role-based access control

4. **Add Email Notifications**
   - Booking confirmations
   - Payment receipts
   - Cancellation notices

5. **Add Image Upload**
   - Setup cloud storage (AWS S3, Cloudinary)
   - Image optimization
   - Multiple image upload

6. **Add Review System**
   - Create review entity
   - Rating calculations
   - Review moderation

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Check if PostgreSQL is running
pg_isready

# Check connection string in .env
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USERNAME=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=cricketapp
DB_DATABASE=cricketapp
```

### TypeORM Sync Issues
If you see errors about missing columns:
1. Drop and recreate tables using migration SQL
2. Or enable `synchronize: true` temporarily

### Authentication Errors
Make sure JWT token is valid and included in headers:
```javascript
headers: {
  'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE'
}
```
