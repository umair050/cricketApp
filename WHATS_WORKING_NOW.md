## 🔧 **Backend Status**

### Current Situation:

The backend is restarting with the fixed configuration.

### The Fix Applied:

```typescript
// Changed synchronize from false to true
synchronize: process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production";
```

This will auto-create all database tables.

### To Check if Backend is Ready:

```bash
# Test in terminal or Git Bash:
curl http://localhost:3001/teams
# If you see [] or team data → Backend is ready!
# If connection error → Still starting, wait 30 seconds
```

---

## 🚀 **Quick Start Guide**

### Step 1: Check Backend

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
cd backend
npm run start:dev
```

**Wait for**: `Nest application successfully started`

### Step 2: Ensure Frontend Running

Open another terminal:

```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

### Step 3: Use the App!

```
http://localhost:3000

Try these workflows:
1. Create a team (Teams page)
2. Browse players (Players page)
3. Create a tournament (Tournaments page)
4. Create a match (Matches page)
5. Post on feed (Feed page)
```
