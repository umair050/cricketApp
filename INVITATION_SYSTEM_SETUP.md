## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Invalid user ID" or "NaN" errors

**Solution**: Make sure you're logged in with a valid user account. If you see this error:

1. Logout from the frontend
2. Re-seed the database: `npx ts-node src/scripts/seed.ts`
3. Login again with one of the test accounts

### Issue: "Cannot find module" errors

**Solution**:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run build

### Issue: Users not showing in search

**Solution**: Make sure the backend server is running and the database has been seeded.
