# Installing Redux

Run this command in the frontend directory:

```bash
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
```

Or if you use yarn:

```bash
yarn add @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
```

This installs:

- `@reduxjs/toolkit` - Official Redux toolkit with createSlice, createAsyncThunk, etc.
- `react-redux` - React bindings for Redux
