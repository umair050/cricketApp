   Body: {
     receiverId: playerId,
     type: "TEAM",
     entityId: teamId,
     message: "Join our team!"
   }

  sender_id, receiver_id, type, entity_id,
  status, message
) VALUES (
  current_user_id, player_id, 'TEAM', team_id,
  'PENDING', 'Join our team!'
);

-- When player accepts:
UPDATE invitations
SET status = 'ACCEPTED'
WHERE id = invitation_id;

VALUES (player_id, team_id, 'PLAYER');
