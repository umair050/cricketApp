## 🎯 **Technical Implementation**

### **1. Free Hit State**

```javascript
const [isFreeHit, setIsFreeHit] = useState(false);

// Set on no-ball
if (outcome.id === "no_ball") {
  setIsFreeHit(true);
}

// Reset after next ball
else if (isFreeHit) {
  setIsFreeHit(false);
}
```

---

### **2. Wicket Type Filtering**

```javascript
const wicketTypes = useMemo(() => {
  const allWickets = [
    "bowled",
    "caught",
    "lbw",
    "run_out",
    "stumped",
    "hit_wicket",
  ];

  // During free hit, only run_out is allowed
  if (isFreeHit) {
    return ["run_out"];
  }

  return allWickets;
}, [isFreeHit]);
```

---

### **3. Extras Flow**

```javascript
const handleBallClick = (outcome) => {
  // Check if bye/leg-bye/wide/no-ball
  if (["bye", "leg_bye", "wide", "no_ball"].includes(outcome.id)) {
    setSelectedExtra(outcome);
    setShowExtraRunsModal(true);
    return;
  }

  // Normal ball
  submitBall(outcome);
};

const handleExtraRunsSubmit = (extraType, additionalRuns) => {
  const totalRuns = (extraType.runs || 0) + additionalRuns;
  const outcomeWithRuns = {
    ...extraType,
    runs: totalRuns,
  };

  submitBall(outcomeWithRuns);
};
```
